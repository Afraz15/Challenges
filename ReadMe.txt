-If there are some missing pics or no styles then try opening the project using live server ( vs code live server extension ).
-these bugs are occuring because the path of the file include '/' in the start. 
-If you don't want to use that then open the files and change their path from '/some-file.css | /img.png' to 'some-file.css | img.png'.
